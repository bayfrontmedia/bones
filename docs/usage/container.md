# Usage: Container

The service container is responsible for storing and resolving dependencies for your application.

Bones uses the [Container library](https://github.com/bayfrontmedia/container) as its service container.

Bones utilizes a variety of services within the framework.
When Bones is started, all required services are bound to the container and available for use, 
referenced by their alias (see table below).

| Service                                  | ID                                                      | Alias        |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Events](../services/events.md)          | `Bayfront\Bones\Application\Services\EventService`      | `events`     |
| [Filters](../services/filters.md)        | `Bayfront\Bones\Application\Services\FilterService`     | `filters`    |
| [HTTP Response](../services/response.md) | `Bayfront\HttpResponse\Response`                        | `response`   |
| [Database](../services/db.md)*           | `Bayfront\PDO\Db`                                       | `db`         |
| [Filesystem](../services/filesystem.md)* | `Bayfront\Filesystem\Filesystem`                        | `filesystem` |
| [Logs](../services/logs.md)*             | `Bayfront\MonologFactory\LoggerFactory`                 | `logs`       |
| [Router](../services/router.md)*         | `Bayfront\RouteIt\Router`                               | `router`     |
| [Scheduler](../services/scheduler.md)*   | `Bayfront\CronScheduler\Cron`                           | `scheduler`  |
| [Veil](../services/veil.md)*             | `Bayfront\Veil\Veil`                                    | `veil`       |

**NOTE:**

\* These services are optional, and will only exist in the container if the associated config file exists in the `/config` directory.

One of the main purposes of Bones is to be as minimal as possible. 
For this reason, you donâ€™t have to use any of the optional services - Bones doesn't even require a router! 
Add any service you'd like to use to the container in the [bootstrap file](bootstrap.md).

## Retrieving the container

Having to retrieve the container instance in order to interact with it directly should be rare,
as all direct interaction should be done in the `/resources/bootstrap.php` file.

However, if the need should arise, you can retrieve the container using the [getContainer](../utilities/app.md#getcontainer) app utility.

## Console commands

The following [console commands](console.md) can be used with relation to the container:

- `alias:list`
- `container:list`
